### reading in ward level data ====

ward <- read.csv(file.choose())
View(ward)
keep <- ward[, 3:4]
View(keep)
ward <- data.frame(keep)
View(ward)
rm(keep)
keep <- ward[1022:1049,]
View(keep)
col.names <- c("Ward", "IMD")
names(ward) <- col.names
ward <- data.frame(ward)
View(ward)
rm(keep, col.names)

## reading in caries data ====

caries <- read.csv(file.choose())
View(caries)
keep <- caries[ ,5:9]
View(keep)
keep$ward.code <- NULL
keep$sound <- NULL
keep$dmft <- NULL
View(keep)
caries <- data.frame(keep)
rm(keep)
View(caries)
caries <- na.omit(caries)
View(caries)
col.names <- c("Ward", "meandmft")
names(caries) <- col.names
View(caries)
rm(col.names)

### Merging the two datasets ====

data <- merge(caries, ward, by = "Ward")
View(data)

### attempting to plot the data ====

#ggplot(adhs, aes(variable1, variable2)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = lm) ## code from Phil

class(data)
class(data$meandmft)
class(data$IMD)
# the IMD data is a 'factor' (a categorical variable) - need to change it to a continuous value

data$IMD <- as.numeric(as.character(data$IMD))

ggplot(data, aes(data$IMD, data$meandmft)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = lm) + xlab("IMD score per ward (2010)") + ylab("Mean dmft per ward (2011/12)")

ggplot(data, aes(data$IMD, data$meandmft, colour = data$meandmft)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = lm) + xlab("IMD score per ward (2010)") + ylab("Mean dmft per ward (2011/12)") + ggtitle("Mean dmft scores in Sheffield - 5 year olds")  + labs(colour = "Mean dmft\nper ward")  

### Finding the R2 value ====

m1 <- lm(data$meandmft ~ data$IMD)
summary(m1)

### Trying to do the same with the data at LSOA level ====

LSOA <-  read.csv(file.choose())
View(LSOA)

# IMD score

keep1 <- LSOA[,1:3]
keep1[,2] <- NULL # getting rid of second column
keep1 <- unique(keep1) # keeps only the unique values, no repetition from other rows
keep1 <- na.omit(keep1)
col.names <- c("lsoacode", "IMD")
names(keep1) <- col.names
View(keep1)

table(duplicated(keep1$lsoacode)) # there are duplicates in this column, they need removing
keep1 <- keep1[-7, ] # make sure you do these one at a time, the '-8' in the next row takes into account the previous row having been deleted
keep1 <- keep1[-8, ]
keep1 <- keep1[-159, ]
keep1 <- keep1[-185, ]
View(keep1)

# lsoa level dmft data - only 338 lsoa's, as data missing for one centrally located lsoa

keep2 <- LSOA[, 1:9]
keep2[, 2]  <- NULL
keep2[, 3]  <- NULL
keep2[, 4]  <- NULL
keep2[, 5]  <- NULL
keep2[, 2]  <- NULL # it goes back to '2' here as the number of columns have decreased, so column 6 wouldn't exist
keep2[, 2]  <- NULL
keep2[, 2]  <- NULL
keep2 <- na.omit(keep2) # getting rid of NA's from meandmft column before joining
col.names <- c("lsoacode", "meandmft")
names(keep2) <- col.names
View(keep2)
rm(col.names)

### merging the data

lsoadata <- merge(keep1, keep2, by = "lsoacode")
View(lsoadata)
rm(keep1, keep2)

class(lsoadata$IMD)
class(lsoadata$meandmft)

### ploting the data and obtaining the R2

ggplot(lsoadata, aes(lsoadata$IMD, lsoadata$meandmft)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = lm) + xlab("IMD score per LSOA (2010)") + ylab("Mean dmft per LSOA (2011/12)")

m2 <- lm(lsoadata$meandmft ~ lsoadata$IMD)
summary(m2)
